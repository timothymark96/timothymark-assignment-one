<h1 style="color: blue">Background</h1>
<p>I was born in Australia and have lived here my whole life, and growing up in in a small town I enjoyed the privilege of seclusion and silence that one might not experience with city living. Whist I enjoyed being distanced from people, I found that due to where I was living I didn’t have much opportunity to meet other people with my same interests in video games, so I became a member of quite a few online communities which have helped shape and broaden my worldview, as well as connect me with people that share my passions. This led to me eventually becoming a community moderator for multiple big names in the game industry such as WB Games, IO Interactive and Double Fine Productions, where I continue to this day working to create positive welcoming spaces for others like me, helping them find a place that they belong.</p>

<h1 style="color: blue">Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My initial interest in IT comes from my experience with video games. I have been playing them forever and have found myself particularly fond of Immersive Sims, which taught me how to think of the world as just a bunch of systems interacting with each other. 
<br><br>
My first immersive sim was Dishonored, and I credit it as the defining experience that kicked off my interest in IT. In an immersive sim, you are given a set of tools, an objective, and are told to complete the objective without being provided any additional guidance. You learn to think about your tools creatively. It’s no longer just ‘bullet creates hole in skull, extinguishing life’, now it is ‘bullet creates a loud noise when hitting the wall next to the guard, guard is startled by the noise and drops his highly flammable alcoholic beverage on the ground, creating a puddle of flammable material, second bullet hits a candle in the old fashioned chandelier on the ceiling, causing the candle to fall and ignite the alcohol, which burns the guard to death, further guards are alarmed and come to investigate, and discover what appears to be an accidental death from a clumsy drunk and a toppled candle, they do not suspect you were ever there’. 
<br><br>
I find the interaction between these systems to be an expression of creativity and I am grateful that these games have gifted me the lens of systemic interaction through which I view the world to this day. I chose this course specifically to learn more about how IT interacts with and shapes the 21st Century, to learn how I can share my ideas with the world, but also how those ideas might interact with humanity, ethics, philosophy, decision making, politics etc. IT systematically impacts everything we know and do, and I want to learn to understand what we have created and will create, lest we cause irreparable damage, but I do believe we can learn to better ourselves and the planet by utilizing IT thoughtfully.</p>

<br><br>
Being a QA Specialist means being the unhappy customer with a hair in their soup, even the smallest lapse in quality can influence public perception and allegiance to a product. As a QA Specialist I would oversee the testing of the games in production, documenting anything that does not meet the quality required to ship, including looking for bugs and errors, problems with art, sound, writing, acting, editing and more, making sure that the product received by the customer is the best it can possibly be. As a QA Specialist I would be working with every area of development and as such I would need to understand how to communicate effectively with people working in different disciplines. 
<br><br>
As a QA Specialist, my foremost role would be as the harbinger between departments on a development team, helping their work come together to form a cohesive product. I would be in communication with contracted QA teams outside of the company, in order to assure they are performing their tests correctly. A large portion of my work would be organising and documenting issues in a way that maximises the efficiency of required fixes and learning to understand what’s crucially important and what is just nit-picking. Above all else, I would need to have an exceptionally developed attention to detail, a learned foresight into what issues may occur before they do, and a vast level of knowledge about common issues in games. 
<br><br>
My current experience in QA is informal but displays potential. In my experience playing with Immersive Sims’ systems, I have learned to deconstruct the elements of games in an attempt to track down exploits and oversights. I have successfully found many unplanned exploits in games due to picking apart and trying to learn the way in which the individual pieces function. I often perform these deconstructions in my mind while daydreaming before attempting them in-game, because my obsessive analysis of these games allows me to understand the results of interactions in my mind without performing them in-game. My best example is when I discovered a glitch in HITMAN (2016) which allowed players to get out of bounds of the normal play space. I discovered this glitch by figuring out that the game can register two inputs on the keyboard if one input requires holding the key, and the other required a quick keypress. If performed all at once, the game cues up the keypress interaction behind the hold key interaction, which can make the character cancel their animation and fall out in unintended areas. <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qtzmyul1C0" >Here is a video I made to share this information with the Hitman community.</a>  
<br><br>
My plan to obtain further QA skills is as follows: 
<br><br>
-Continue to analyse how games are put together, and learn to deconstruct and understand the game files in order to create modifications to games, furthering my understanding of how they work. 
<br><br>
-Learn programming skills, essential for understanding how software works. 
<br><br>
-Obtain an ISTQB certification. 
<br><br>
-Get a job in a Junior QA position.</p>

<h1 style="color: purple">Test Results</h1>
<p>16 Personalities – The Mediator 
<br><br>
Learning Style – Tactile/Kinaesthetic 
<br><br>
Testmycreativity.com - Creativity score of 87.26 (Average score is 63.09) </p>

<h1 style="color: purple">Personal Profile</h1>
<p>My reactions to these three tests varied. In the 16 Personalities test, I strongly associate with the description of me being a calm figure hiding an inner flame of passion for what I care about. I also agree that when I find people who care about the same as I do, I become filled with novel thoughts, inspirations, ideas, and the will to act upon them, and I definitely express myself through artistic endeavours. There were however some parts of the conclusion I totally disagree with. I do not find that my principles dictate my path through life, but instead a mix of principles and logical decision making. I am freely open to my principles shifting as life rolls on. 
<br><br>
The second test I wholeheartedly agree with the results for. I am a Kinaesthetic learner and have been my entire life. I need to engage directly with what I am learning. I need to be able to turn it around, poke it, throw it, drop it in acid. I do not need to do all of this with my physical hands, playing games and being able to interface with learning environments virtually is also a highly kinaesthetic place for me. I can learn about orbital physics by experimenting with them in a game which models them for example. 
<br><br>
The final test was testing my creativity. I tend to think of these tests as somewhat dubious, as creativity is notoriously difficult to measure, and there are likely a million blind spots in the test. Apparently I am ‘87.26’ creative, which is a meaningless result as it is a simple number, even when compared to the average ‘63.09’ result. When we don’t know what they are measuring against, no meaningful conclusion can truly be reached, and I can’t personally derive much insight from this test. I do however feel I am a highly creative-driven person. If I’m not working on a project or expressing myself in some way creatively, I feel a cold hollow form inside me. It deadens my eyes and stiffens my gait, and I feel at a distance to myself and the people I love, so it’s not surprising to me that this test affirmed my creative needs. 
<br><br>
I work well in a team environment. I have been a leader of many teams, but the teams I lead are always ones that I have assembled around a concept that I have initially devised, so I am used to driving forward work on ideas and projects that I agree with creatively, politically and morally. I can see myself taking issue with working in a team on a project I morally disagree with, and I would not function anywhere close to my capacity. If I was in a team that I generally agreed with, I would take on roles such as prototyping ideas, examining and testing models, and other tasks that involve my direct poking and prodding at the team’s work, looking for things to praise and critique. I would be a creative problem solver. I have found myself in the past causing issues in teams because my solutions are so completely left-of-field that they seem ridiculous, but I do put a lot of consideration into these unusual solutions and they generally work, it can just be difficult convincing team members that I am onto a good idea. I thrive in teams that welcome all thoughts and comments, however insane they may appear at first, and I consider strongly the open-mindedness of team members when I am looking to form a team. </p>

<h1 style="color: teal">Project Idea: True Noir (Video Game)</h1>
<p>True Noir is a PC puzzle adventure game where you play a blind detective tasked with solving a gruesome murder. True Noir is unique as the game will have no graphics whatsoever, and will be entirely playable by someone who is also blind in real life. The game will focus strongly on creating an immersive audio soundscape to explore, find clues, solve puzzles and ultimately crack the case. 
<br><br>
I want to make True Noir as I feel that the barrier to video games for someone who cannot see is often insurmountable, as being able to visually navigate a character through a world is a core part of most games. I believe that everyone, regardless of any disability they may have, should be able to enjoy playing games and I would love to create an experience for someone who is blind. My hope is that the game can also help others think about how they could make their own games more accessible. 
<br><br>
True Noir will control as a first-person puzzle game, with all clues and the environment being delivered through the highly detailed audio world. Players will interact with the game with only a computer mouse, where they can rotate in-place 360 degrees in each ‘room’ in the game, orienting themselves with the 3D soundscape. For example, the player is facing towards a dripping tap, and they can hear an air conditioner to their right. As they move the mouse right the dripping tap will get quieter and the AC louder, creating a sense of 3D space around them. Players can click when facing any direction to hear a comment by the detective like a voice over in a noir film, as they describe what they feel, smell and hear in the direction they are facing. The game will feature three types of puzzles: 
<br><br>
Puzzle type one is picking up on environmental audio clues. The player must pay close attention, as they may hear unusual sounds like wind whistling through a cracked window, or the crunch of broken glass underfoot, which may provide helpful evidence for the case and is worth remembering. 
<br><br>
Puzzle type two is questioning suspects. The player can question a handful of witnesses and suspects at the scene of the crime, and if they pay close attention they might spot inconsistencies and flaws in their alibis and the answers to your questions. 
<br><br>
Puzzle type three is traversal. As the detective is blind, they must use their knowledge of the environment and the sounds they can hear to figure out how to traverse the world. This puzzle type is like a slow unfolding maze that you build the pathway through in your mind as you play. It will become easier to navigate the more familiar the player is with the environments. 
<br><br>
Music will play a mechanical role in the game, however most of the game will not feature music. My reason for choosing not to have a constant soundtrack is so that it does not distract from or obscure the environmental audio, however when the player succeeds solving a puzzle or completes an objective, a jazzy sting will play indicating success. The game will have music in the introduction and at the ending when the case is solved. 
<br><br>
One of the most important parts of the game will be designing a clear and concise tutorial. Since True Noir’s control scheme and concept is entirely unique, the game will begin with a spoken tutorial explaining how the gameplay, movement and puzzles function. This tutorial will take place in the detective’s office and will be the introduction scene to the game, leading into the main story. The instructions will be delivered in a comedic manner with the setup being that the Detective’s smart device (i.e. Google Nest/Amazon Alexa) is malfunctioning and delivering a ‘how to be a detective’ tutorial. The soundscape of the office will be relatively simple compared to the rest of the game as to not overwhelm the player and allow them to get the hang of things in a safe place. The tutorial will conclude when the smart device begins to receive a phone call about the murder. 
<br><br>
True Noir will be built using the Icicle Engine. Icicle Engine is a game engine created by my friend Josh ‘Cheeseness’ Bush to create ‘first-person text adventures’, and is currently unreleased to the general public. He graciously provided me with access to the software for university purposes and this project will test the limits of the engine. (Josh “Cheeseness” Bush, pers. conv., September 17th 2020) To create the audio, I will use an audio recording device I own to record sounds. Any sounds I cannot create myself I will find on royalty-free creative commons attribution sites, and provide full credit. 
<br><br>
I have prior experience in the Icicle Engine from when I participated in a game jam and created a short game called The Good Doctor. I found the engine interface easy to use, requiring no programming or scripting knowledge, and with the tutorials provided I believe anyone could pick up this software and begin to create. As mentioned, I have an audio recording device to record environmental sounds, and for the voices I will either record them myself or ask friends to record for me. I have experience editing audio and mixing sound with the free program ‘Audacity’, having worked on multiple personal projects and music albums. 
<br><br>
If True Noir is successful, I believe that it will have a positive impact upon the lives of people who are blind and thought they could never play a video game. I want them to discover that it is possible to be deeply immersed in an interactive world, and that if one game like this can exist, why couldn’t more be made? I hope to deliver an experience akin to putting on a VR headset for the first time, where I transport them to another world and allow them to experience the joy of a fully immersive interactive audio simulation. A secondary hope I hold is that the game will encourage developers who are not blind to consider how they could make their games more accessible to a wider range of people. Even if a game is not primarily designed for someone with a disability, I believe that there should be far more accessibility options added to games wherever possible, and that every person should be able to experience the joy of playing a video game. </p>
